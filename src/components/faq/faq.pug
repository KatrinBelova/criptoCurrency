						h3 How Do You Determine Which Coins to Buy?
						p Inside of CryptoSig, we have a requests section where you can request ANY coin to be added to our watch list. Once a coin is in our watch list and we feel it's a good buy, you’ll be getting a signal.

						h3 How Many Signals Do You Post Per Day?
						p We only post signals when we’re 100% confident of the trade. This means that if the market as a whole is in a down trend, we may not post at all. Other days when the market is performing better, we may post 4-5

						h3 Do You Also Provide Sell Signals?
